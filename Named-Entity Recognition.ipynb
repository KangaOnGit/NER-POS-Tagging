      "Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) was performed to visualize proper positioning of the guidewire and cannula.\n",
      "Using the Seldinger technique, the right internal jugular vein was accessed and a guide wire was placed.\n",
      "Placement of the guidewire into the IVC proved difficult due to repeated migration of the guidewire into the right ventricle.\n",
      "After multiple attempts, the guidewire was visualized to course properly from the SVC to the IVC.\n",
      "After a bolus dose of 5000 units of intravenous heparin was given, the right internal jugular venous access site was dilated.\n",
      "Just as the final dilatation was completed and upon dilator exchange with simultaneous advancement of the 23 French Avalon cannula, TEE lost visualization of the guidewire.\n",
      "Multiple premature ventricular beats were noted and immediately, a new, rapidly enlarging pericardial effusion was detected (Figure ​(Figure2).2).\n",
      "Emergent preparations were made for bedside surgical decompression of the pericardial space.\n",
      "Quickly the patient lost blood pressure from acute cardiac tamponade.\n",
      "The Avalon cannula was immediately clamped at the end but not removed.\n",
      "A emergent subxiphoid pericardial window was performed, resulting in drainage of venous blood and restoration of blood pressure.\n",
      "Transfusion was initiated and the patient was emergently transported to the operating room for surgical exploration.\n",
      "The Avalon cannula was found to have perforated the apex of the right ventricle.\n",
      "The injury was repaired primarily and the Avalon cannula was repositioned toward the IVC again by TEE with additional direct manipulation.\n",
      "VV-ECMO was initiated and the oxygenation improved.\n",
      "Due to excessive coagulopathies, the sternum was left open but was closed on postoperative day 2.\n",
      "From that point, she remained free from any cardiac or infectious complications and her pulmonary condition slowly improved.\n",
      "She was successfully weaned from VV-ECMO on postoperative day 9 and was discharged home on postoperative day 24 without the need for home oxygen.\n",

      "We began to administer 4 L/min of oxygen nasally and empirical antibiotics with third generation cephalosporin and macrolide following a diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia.\n",
      "On the second day in the hospital, the patient’s fever was sustained and he complained of dyspnea.\n",
      "His hypoxemia was aggravated such that he required 7 L/min of oxygen via a simple mask and the consolidation and pleural effusion had markedly progressed (Fig.2a).\n",

      "He had previously been well without any additional relevant or abnormal symptoms.\n",
      "Physical examination suggested no significant abnormalities.\n",
      "Laboratory findings were within normal range, except for a carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level of 30.25 ng/mL (normal range, 0–5 ng/mL) found in the serum.\n",
      "Subsequently, a positron emission tomography (PET)/CT scan showed a lung lesion with a standardized uptake value of 7.94, which was highly suspected to be a malignant tumor (Fig.1).\n",
      "Subsequently, he underwent left upper lung lobectomy and lymph node dissection.\n",
      "Postoperative pathological examination revealed an adenocarcinoma (ADC) (Fig.2A).\n",
      "Immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining results were positive for CK7, TTF-1, p63, and NapsinA and negative for CK 5/6, Syn, cgA, and Ki-67 (20%–30%).\n",
      "The clinical stage was classified as IA2 (pT1bN0M0).\n",
      "Because the tumor was still in an early stage, the patient did not receive adjuvant treatment but continued to be monitored through regular hospital visits every 3 months.\n",
      "The patient's condition had been stable until the onset of left chest pain in April 2015.\n",
      "The patient was transferred to our hospital (a tertiary care hospital) for further treatment.\n",
      "Physical examination suggested a significant tender point in the left chest wall.\n",
      "Laboratory findings showed only a single parameter outside the normal range: the cytokeratin19 fragment antigen 21–1 (CYFRA21–1) level was 17.45 ng/mL in the serum (normal range = 0–3.3 ng/mL).\n",
      "CT and PET/CT scans highlighted the serious involvement of left pleura, showing bilateral lung lesions (Fig.3A and E).\n",
      "At that point, the clinical stage was upgraded to IVB.\n",
      "After the CT-guided left pleura puncture, pathological IHC analysis showed positive staining for p63, p40, CK 7, and CK 5/6, while TTF-1 and NapsinA staining were absent, supporting a diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) (Fig.2B).\n",
      "Meanwhile, molecular evaluation confirmed an L858R mutation in exon 21 and a T790M mutation in exon 20 (Fig.4B and C).\n",
      "Considering the pathology of the SCC was quite distinct compared with that of the originally resected NSCLC specimen, we retrospectively reassessed the surgery specimen to verify our primary diagnosis.\n",
      "The morphologic and IHC results were in complete agreement with the initial diagnoses, but an L858R mutation was identified using the newly added molecular evaluation (Fig.4A).\n",
      "To relieve the acute pain in the left pleura as quickly as possible, palliative three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT) for the chest lesion was delivered at a total dose of 42 Gy/14 fractions (f), once daily and 5f/week (Fig.5).\n",
      "The volume over radiation dose 5 Gy (V5) values of the left, right, and total lungs were 20%, 0%, and 7.8%, respectively; the volume over radiation dose 20 Gy (V20) values were 10%, 0%, and 5%, respectively; the mean lung dose (MLD) was 5 Gy.\n",
      "Meanwhile, considering the MST pathology was that of SCC, the patient received GP chemotherapy (cisplatin 75 mg/m2 d1, gemcitabine 1250 mg/m2 d1, d8, for 21 days as a cycle) for 4 cycles, and the patient achieved partial remission (PR) after 2 cycles, followed by stable disease (SD) after 4 cycles (Fig.3[B3[B and F] and [C and G]) according to response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST) 1.1.\n",
      "Then, gefitinib (150 mg qd) was used as maintenance treatment from November 2015 onward.\n",
      "During the treatment, Ibandronate sodium was given monthly for skeletal-related events.\n",

      "He was diagnosed with a total of 84 NMSC: 72 NMSC at our clinic, 12 from other clinics.\n",
      "He was also awaiting biopsy and removal for additional lesions.\n",
      "His CD was initially treated with sulfasalazine and intermittent steroids at diagnosis, but for the past 20 years he had been taking 6-MP daily.\n",
      "In the first ten years after beginning 6-MP he developed 30 NMSC; 14 were squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and 16 were basal cell carcinoma (BCC).\n",
      "The patient was then treated elsewhere for the subsequent ten years.\n",
      "This past year, however, he returned to the clinic with over 100 new lesions suggestive of malignancy on his torso and extremities.\n",
      "Subsequent to this exam, he had 42 biopsy-proven lesions of NMCS; 20 were SCC and 22 were BCC.\n",
      "In addition, three of the SCCs were moderately differentiated and two were poorly differentiated and some of his larger skin cancers have necessitated Mohs surgery and xenografting.\n",

      "At age 16 years the patient still had granulomatous retinal lesions and anterior chamber inflammation, and macular edema developed, which led to retinal detachment.\n",
      "In addition to the other steroid therapy, corticosteroid pulse therapy was necessary to control disease flares, with an average of 3 boluses/month for 6 consecutive months.\n",
      "Because of the supposed autoinflammatory nature of Blau syndrome, we initiated a trial of IL-1 antibody administration (2 mg/kg/month of canakinumab).\n",

      "Three-dimensional imaging proved that the tumor was fed by a main vessel from the inferior mesenteric artery (red arrow) and by an accessory feeder from the superior mesenteric artery (Figure 3).\n",
      "Fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) and positron emission tomography-computed tomography did not detect the tumor (Figure 4), although we thought positron emission tomography-computed tomography was helpful to identify other metastatic tumors.\n",
      "Further imaging findings revealed no other intrahepatic or extrahepatic metastasis.\n",
      "Based on the tumor location, the clinical diagnosis was solitary metastasis to a mesocolic LN or HCC dissemination.\n",
      "Determining the ideal therapeutic strategy for solitary but extrahepatic rare metastasis was difficult.\n",
      "Although rapid growth was a critical concern in this case, the tumor was solitary and not accompanied by other metastases.\n",
      "Considering both diagnostic and therapeutic viewpoints, we finally chose surgical resection in this case.\n",
      "No disseminative nodules, lymphadenopathy, or ascites was observed during surgery.\n",
      "The tumor was located in the mesocolon nearly at the wall of the descending colon, and partial resection of the descending colon with regional mesocolon was performed.\n",
      "The patient’s postoperative course was uneventful, and she was discharged on postoperative day 8.\n",
      "Serum levels of tumor marker decreased immediately after surgery (Figure 1).\n",

      "A yellowish nodule was encapsulated in the cut surface (Figure 5B).\n",
      "The enlarged LN contained metastatic HCC with a ductal structure (Figure 6A), and immunohistochemically, the tumor was positive for AFP and negative for CK-20, which was consistent with the pattern of primary HCC (Figure 6B).\n",
      "The histopathological diagnosis was metastatic HCC to a mesocolic LN.\n",
      "As of the writing of this report, the patient has remained free of recurrence for 13 months after the second surgery, and has also been carefully followed up.\n",

      "Mid-distal esophagectomy was performed with oesophagogastric anastomosis and gastric tube reconstruction.\n",
      "Pathological examination of the surgical specimen confirmed the biopsy diagnosis of poorly differentiated (G3) SCC.\n",
      "The tumor, which measured 3 cm of length, had infiltrated the oesophageal wall and the surrounding paraesophageal fat.\n",
      "Surgical margins were tumor-free, as the seven perigastric limph-nodes dissected (pT3 N0).\n",
      "The postoperative period was quite unremarkable, and a contrast enhanced x-ray obtained on the 9th POD showed normal esophageal and gastric transit.\n",
      "On the 14th POD, the patient was discharged with an oncology referral for routine medical follow-up.\n",
      "Nine months after the operation, CT and esophagogastroduodenoscopy were repeated.\n",
      "The imaging study revealed mild splenomegaly with multiple nonspecific nodules within the organ (Figure ​1).\n",

      "On 12th December 2007, the patient had transabdominal total splenectomy with splenic and celiac artery lymph node dissection.\n",
      "The postoperative course was uneventful.\n",
      "On the 7th postoperative day, Doppler ultrasonography revealed portal-tree patency with no signs of thrombosis.\n",
      "Ten days later, the patient was discharged with a stable platelet count (780,000/mm3), Hb 10.9 g/dL, and a WBC count of 16,500/mm3.\n",
      "Pathological examination of the spleen described multiple nodules containing medium to large-sized cells, some of which were keratinized.\n",
      "The nodules were mostly solid with areas of central necrosis (Figure ​3).\n",
      "The findings were consistent with metastases of SCC.\n",

      "She had been receiving parenteral nutrition for two months following removal of the PEG tube due to infection.\n",
      "Although the differential diagnosis included drug hypersensitivity, autoimmune disorders and nutritional deficiency, the rash appearance was most consistent with acrodermatitis enteropathica-like eruption secondary to zinc deficiency.\n",
      "Her serum zinc level was 12 mcg/dL (normal, 55–150 mcg/dL), and the rash resolved within one week of parenteral zinc supplementation (Fig.1b, d).\n",
      "Zinc is essential for protein synthesis and wound healing.\n",
      "Acrodermatitis enteropathica presents in infancy as a periorificial desquamative dermatitis, resulting from an autosomal recessive mutation that impairs zinc absorption. A similar syndrome may occur due to nutritional zinc deficiency, and has been reported in the setting of parenteral nutrition that fails to include zinc supplementation; a prompt response to supplementation helps to confirm the diagnosis.\n",

      "As prolonged mechanical ventilation was expected, a tracheostomy was previously performed.\n",
      "After an initial CT scan (figure 2A), a follow-up CT scan (figure 2B) a month after the surgery showed a resolution of the posterior-basal atelectasis, coinciding with a decrease of FiO2 to 0.21.\n",
      "Postoperatively, the patient was on the Servo-i ventilator in a volume-controlled mode and needed variable PIPs between 25 and 45 cm H2O and PEEP values of 7–11 cm H2O.\n",
      "During the attempts to wean the patient off the ventilator in the following months, he was unable to activate the inspiratory flow trigger and required significant sedoanalgesia to adapt to the ventilator due to repeated episodes of desaturation, on some occasions with bradycardia, associated to bronchial collapse.\n",
      "He continued to have asynchrony which required boluses of sedation in addition to existing medications.\n",
      "He initially received fentanyl and midazolam through a continuous infusion pump with progressive increase in the doses as well as continuous cisatracurium as a muscular relaxant to adapt to mechanical ventilation (figure 3).\n",
      "As clinical stabilisation was achieved, the muscular relaxant was withdrawn and a progressive decrease of sedation was initiated along with a change in the drug regimen.\n",
      "During this period, the patient developed an ocular flutter which was attributed to a pharmacological cause after neurological alterations were ruled out with normal EEG, ophthalmoscopy, metabolic workup and cranial MRI.\n",
      "At 5 months of age, the NAVA mode started to improve the patient's adaptation to the ventilator through the use of a neural trigger.\n",
      "The NAVA catheter additionally costs around €200 per catheter; according to the manufacturer it should be changed every 5 days.\n",

      "The patient had tidal volumes (Vt) of 6–7 mL/kg (figure 3).\n",
      "After 10 days on the NAVA mode, he did not require any type of sedation and the sporadic episodes of bronchial collapse were resolved with a quick increase of PEEP to 20 cm H2O or manual ventilation with the self-inflating bag.\n",
      "Once he was stabilised on the NAVA mode, his PIPs oscillated between 15 and 45 cm H2O with a NAVA level of 0.4 and Edi peaks between 15 and 100 µV.\n",
      "A posterior pulmonary CT scan performed 2 months after the first surgery, 1 month after starting NAVA and prior to the first thoracic expansion, showed a significant reduction in the posterobasal atelectases previously observed (figure 2B).\n",

      "Laboratory analysis revealed the following values: white blood cell count, 7730/μL (3500–11,000/μL); hemoglobin, 8.6 g/dL (12–16 g/dL): platelet count, 87000/μL (150,000–400,000/μL); blood urea nitrogen, 78 mg/dL (6–21 mg/dL); creatinine, 8.9 mg/dL (1.1–1.5 mg/dL); calcium, 8.2 mg/dL (8.8–10.3 mg/dL); phosphorus, 5.4 mg/dL (2.7–4.5 mg/dL); haptoglobin, <6.56 mg/dL (30–200 mg/dL); and lactate dehydrogenase, 547 U/L (106–211 U/L).\n",
      "A routine urinalysis revealed a proteinuria score of 2+ (200 mg/dL), white blood cell count of 3–5/high power field, and red blood cell count of 25–50/high power field.\n",
      "The autoimmune profile indicated an antinuclear antibody level of 1:320 (speckles; normal, <1:40).\n",
      "Tests for anti-Scl70, anti-double-stranded DNA, anti-Ro, anti-La, and anticardiolipin antibodies were all negative.\n",
      "Kidney echogram showed a decreased bilateral kidney size without hydronephrosis.\n",
      "Despite the chronic changes visible on the echogram, the patient had developed acute pulmonary edema and oligouria only 3 days before admission.\n",
      "Accordingly, a clinical diagnosis of acute-on-chronic renal failure was made.\n",
      "A further diagnosis of SRC was supported by the presence of renal failure with microangiopathic hemolytic anemia and hypertension, and the patient was started on captopril therapy.\n",
      "The sustained deterioration in renal function and anuria had led to a requirement for regular hemodialysis from admission.\n",
      "After 3 days, captopril was changed to amlodipine because the patient developed a severe, intolerable cough thought to be associated with captopril.\n",
      "His systolic blood pressure was controlled between 140 and 180 mm Hg.\n",
      "At approximately 3 weeks after the initiation of maintenance hemodialysis, the patient newly developed a generalized tonic-clonic seizure disorder.\n",
      "A brain computed tomography (CT) scan revealed a small lacunar infarct over the left basal ganglion without intracranial hemorrhage or large infarct.\n",
      "The seizure resolved spontaneously without anticonvulsants, and the patient was finally discharged home without incident and scheduled for regular hemodialysis thrice weekly.\n",
      "However, at 1 week after discharge, the patient developed a sudden-onset headache and vomiting with confusion and recurrence of the generalized tonic-clonic seizure.\n",
      "He presented at the emergency department with a blood pressure of 183/100 mm Hg, platelet count of 149,000/μL, serum LDH of 332 U/L, and a peripheral blood smear containing 2–3 schizocytes/HPF (Fig.2).\n",
      "Brain CT revealed no interval change, and lumbar puncture revealed traumatic tapping only.\n",
      "Cerebrospinal fluid cultures were negative for bacteria, mycobacteria, and viruses.\n",
      "Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed bilateral hyperintensity in the occipital and parietal lobes on a fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) sequence (Fig.3).\n",
      "Finally, the patient was diagnosed with PRES.\n",
      "We resumed captopril therapy at a dose of 25 mg thrice daily.\n",
      "As it was difficult to differentiate SRC from TTP, we also considered plasma exchange treatment.\n",
      "However, the patient's mental status returned to normal within 3 days in the absence of plasma exchange, and a follow-up MRI of the brain 2 months later showed complete resolution of cerebral edema (Fig.4).\n",
      "Therefore, SRC-related PRES was confirmed.\n",
      "Although the patient experienced a full neurologic recovery, his renal function did not improve and he remained dialysis dependent.\n",
      "\n",
      "The patient was a 48-year-old man who had previously been hospitalized due to hemoptysis at 42 years of age.\n",
      "At that time, a chest radiograph and chest computed tomography (CT) revealed diffuse ground-glass opacity (GGO) in the bilateral lung fields (Fig.1,2), and a bronchoscopic examination revealed the accumulation of large amounts of blood in the trachea and bronchi (Fig.3).\n",
      "The patient's bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was bloody and contained numerous hemosiderin-laden macrophages.\n",
      "A culture test of the BALF revealed no findings.\n",
      "An electrocardiogram and transthoracic echocardiogram revealed no abnormalities.\n",
      "A questionnaire that was completed at that time did not reveal the patient's hemorrhagic episode or a family history of bleeding disease, with the exception of his younger brother who had been diagnosed with hepatitis C.\n",
      "Furthermore, he had not received any drugs that had the potential to cause DAH.\n",
      "Following the above-mentioned examinations, DAH due to some sort of vasculitis was suspected.\n",
      "Thus, treatment with high-dose intravenous methylprednisolone (1,000 mg daily) for 3 days followed by prednisolone (25 mg daily) was initiated.\n",
      "This relieved his symptoms.\n",
      "Chest CT showed the resolution of the GGO.\n",
      "The patient's prednisolone dose was tapered and eventually discontinued at two-and-a-half years after his discharge from our hospital.\n",
      "The patient was readmitted to our hospital with a recurrence of hemoptysis at 46 years of age.\n",
      "The above-described therapy was initiated and led to the improvement of his condition.\n",
      "The prednisolone dose was tapered from 60 mg daily to a maintenance dose of 5 mg daily.\n",
      "At 48 years of age, he was readmitted to our hospital with a further recurrence of hemoptysis.\n",
      "At this point, he had steroid-induced diabetes mellitus, which was treated with glimepiride (3 mg daily).\n",
      "At admission, his weight was 75 kg and height 167 cm; his vital signs were as follows: blood pressure, 178/102 mmHg; pulse rate, 109 beats/min, pulse oximetry, 97% in room air; and body temperature, 36.8°C.\n",
      "Chest auscultation revealed fine crackles in the right lung field.\n",
      "No skin rash, subcutaneous bleeding or joint swelling were present.\n",
      "A chest radiograph and CT showed the presence of diffuse GGO in the bilateral lung fields.\n",
      "Mild anemia was observed (hemoglobin, 11.3 g/dL), although hemoglobin levels had been 14.6 g/dL prior to the hemoptysis episode.\n",
      "The activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) was prolonged to 53.5 seconds (normal range, 25.1-40.7 seconds).\n",
      "Laboratory tests showed that the patient's blood glucose and hemoglobin A1c levels were 299 mg/dL and 8.2%, respectively, due to the steroid-induced diabetes mellitus.\n",
      "Autoantibodies for various collagen diseases were negative (Table).\n",
      "We diagnosed the condition as a recurrence of DAH and again administered high-dose intravenous methylprednisolone for 3 days, followed by prednisolone (60 mg daily).\n",
      "His condition improved, as had been observed during the previous episodes.\n",
      "A further detailed inquiry regarding the patient's medical history revealed that, as an elementary school student, he had been hospitalized and had received blood transfusions twice following abnormally heavy bleeding after tooth extraction; however, a specific congenital bleeding disorder had not been diagnosed at that time.\n",
      "It was also revealed that his younger brother had been diagnosed with hemophilia B during adolescence.\n",
      "Considering the possibility of hemophilia, his blood coagulation factors were examined, revealing that his factor IX activity was 3%.\n",
      "The patient was subsequently diagnosed with moderate hemophilia B.\n",
      "By the time of this diagnosis, the patient's DAH had already resolved with the corticosteroid therapy.\n",
      "We decided to continue treating the patient using prednisolone alone, without coagulation factor IX replacement therapy.\n",
      "No recurrence of DAH or hemorrhagic symptoms have been observed during 3 years since the tapering and discontinuation of prednisolone.\n",
      "\n",
      "A 68-year-old man was referred by his optometrist to HES with suspected LTG due to repeatedly irregular visual field test results, advanced optic disc cupping, normal intraocular pressures (IOPs) and a family history of glaucoma.\n",
      "The patient subjectively felt that vision in his ‘good’ left eye (LE), which normally had a visual acuity of 6/6 N5, started to deteriorate 6 months earlier; at the point of referral it was best corrected to 6/7.5 N6.\n",
      "His right eye (RE) was known to be amblyopic with a visual acuity of 6/18 N12.\n",
      "His medical history included considerable risk factors for systemic vasculopathy, such as hypertension, hypercholesterolaemia, 50 pack-years of smoking and type 2 diabetes with no diabetic retinopathy.\n",
      "Despite detailed questioning, he denied any new systemic symptoms apart from experiencing increased lethargy.\n",
      "Clinical examination at HES revealed advanced bilateral cupped optic discs with a cup-to-disc ratio right 0.9 (90%) and left 0.8 (80%; figure 1).\n",
      "Furthermore, the findings from the referring optometrist of equal and reactive pupils, normal eye movements and IOPs in mid-teens were confirmed.\n",
      "Computerised perimetry showed constricted visual fields in both eyes, albeit with considerably raised false-negative error rates in excess of 30% (figure 2A).\n",
      "Since this can be a result of poor concentration and attention span with testing compounded, especially with an amblyopic RE, the field test was repeated 4 weeks later with similar results (figure 2B).\n",
      "At this visit, the patient experienced further deterioration of his ‘good’ LE.\n",
      "Visual acuities measured 6/24 (loss of one Snellen line) N36 in his amblyopic RE, and 6/18 (loss of two Snellen lines) N36 in his LE, which now also showed depressed colour vision.\n",
      "An urgent scan of the patient's head and orbit was requested to rule out a compressive lesion and blood analysis was carried out to screen for other causes of optic neuropathy including vitamin B12, folate levels and inflammatory markers.\n",
      "MRI revealed a large mass centred at the pituitary fossa measuring approximately 4.5 cm×5.1 cm× 4.8 cm (figure 3A–C) extending into the suprasellar cistern and infrasellar sphenoid sinuses.\n",
      "The optic chiasm and both optic nerves were displaced superiorly and compressed on both sides.\n",
      "The mass showed heterogeneous T1 and T2 signals with multiple fluid levels most likely due to previous haemorrhage and low-signal components suggesting calcifications.\n",
      "The appearance was probably due to a craniopharyngioma or haemorrhagic pituitary adenoma.\n",
      "The patient was referred urgently to the neurosurgery unit and was found to have markedly raised prolactin levels of greater than 200 000 mIU/L, confirming the diagnosis of a giant prolactinoma.\n",
      "In cooperation with the local endocrinology service, he was started on cabergoline 500 µg and dexamethasone 8 mg.\n",
      "Within a week this led to a dramatic improvement of the patient's visual fields and acuities to 6/18 RE and to 6/9 LE.\n",
      "His prolactin levels showed a similar dramatic response with levels coming down to 336 mIU/L.\n",
      "Three months later his visual acuity in his RE and LE were 6/18 and 6/5, respectively, and visual field examination showed striking recovery with almost normal results (figure 2C).\n",

      "On examination, he was morbidly obese (BMI 45) and was noted to have marked hepatomegaly.\n",
      "This was not associated with any recent weight loss, haematemesis, jaundice or abdominal pain.\n",
      "The patient denied previous blood transfusions, usage of intravenous drugs and did not drink alcohol.\n",
      "A faecal occult blood test was negative, and the patient’s last colonoscopy 2 years prior was unremarkable.\n",
      "He was referred to our tertiary centre for further management after an ultrasound scan (USS) displayed an ovoid mass of mixed echogenicity arising from the liver, measuring 12 × 9 cm.\n",
      "A computed tomography (CT) scan confirmed a malignant appearing, pedunculated lesion attached to segment IV (Fig.1).\n",
      "A subsequent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) confirmed that on T2 weighted imaging (WI), the lesion was isointense to the liver peripherally with central branching hyperintensities (Fig.2a) which corresponded to the hypointensities seen on T1WI (Fig.2b).\n",
      "Enhancement of the lesion was noted in arterial phase (Fig.3a), during portal venous phase (Fig.3b) and at 2 min (Fig.3c), with some central areas of non-enhancement.\n",
      "The lesion becomes slightly hypointense on delayed images at 10 (Fig.3d) and 20 min compared to the surrounding liver.\n",

      "The patient was discharged postoperative day seven without complications.\n",
      "Pathology of the resection specimen confirmed SFTL.\n",
      "The specimen displayed a pale tan nodular appearance with a firm and rubbery cut surface.\n",
      "Histological examination revealed fascicles of spindle cells in storiform arrangement with a pushing margin.\n",
      "There was evidence of extracellular collagen deposition, areas of myxoid stroma and branching vessels with hyalinisation.\n",
      "The specimen displayed a high mitotic rate of up to 9 per 10 high-power fields (HPF) with no necrotic or haemorrhagic features.\n",
      "Immunohistochemistry showed positive staining for CD34, CD99 and BCL-2.\n",
      "The tumour was negative for c-Kit, CD31, SMA, desmin, cytokeratins (AE1/AE3, MNF116 and Cam 5.2), EMA and S100.\n",

      "There were two episodes of re-admissions for further investigation of recurrent right upper quadrant pain between 2011 and 2013.\n",
      "Multiple MRI scans performed during this period revealed expected postsurgical changes with no tumour recurrence.\n",
      "However, in May 2016, the patient presented to his local emergency department with progressively worsening right upper quadrant pain and increasing dyspnoea with an oxygen demand.\n",
      "CT of his chest, abdomen and pelvis revealed extensive tumour recurrence adjacent to the previous resection site (Fig.4).\n",

      "Pleurocentesis was performed, draining 1400 ml of serosanguineous fluid.\n",
      "Cytology was negative for malignant cells.\n",
      "The case was discussed extensively in a multi-disciplinary setting, and it was decided given the patient’s two sites of disease and significant perioperative risk that he was not a candidate for radical reoperation.\n",
      "There were also no suitable chemo- or radiotherapeutic therapies available.\n",

      "We attempted to identify the bleeding site on gastrointestinal endoscopy, to no avail, but a CT scan revealed the rapid enlargement of a liver tumor in the left lobe, which contained partial high-density areas on the plain scan, and also a novel finding of ascites showing higher density than usual, all suggesting a ruptured liver metastasis and associated hemorrhagic ascites (Fig.2).\n",
      "A subsequent contrast-enhanced CT image was negative for extravasation.\n",
      "He underwent angiography for the left and right hepatic arteries, but we only observed obscure tumor vessels in the left hepatic lobe without extravasation (Fig.3A).\n",
      "We suspected this might be due to the hypovascularity of the metastatic tumors and inactive bleeding at the time.\n",
      "Although the benefit of therapeutic embolization of the hepatic artery was uncertain based on the findings on angiography, we performed transcatheter arterial embolization (TAE) of the left main hepatic artery using gelform particles to prevent future re-bleeding.\n",
      "Post-embolization angiography revealed a slowed blood flow in the left hepatic artery, and the peripheral vessels were weakly visualized (Fig.3B).\n",
      "After the embolization concomitant with supportive therapies, including RBC transfusions of 6 U in total, the clinical course of the patient stabilized.\n",

      "Historically, hyperparathyroidism is associated with bone disease, renal stones and neuromuscular dysfunction, however, with the current screening modalities, most patients are caught early and often asymptomatic.3 Primary hyperparathyroidism is most commonly caused by a parathyroid adenoma.\n",
      "Infrequent causes include parathyroid hyperplasia, which would affect all four glands and rarely caused by parathyroid carcinoma.\n",
      "Markedly elevated serum PTH and calcium levels leading to severe renal and bone manifestations are helpful in the diagnosis of cancer, however, it is usually discovered operatively based on local invasion and metastases.3\n",
      "The primary indication for parathyroidectomy, historically, is for symptomatic patients.\n",
      "Currently, since most patients are caught earlier, there are newer indications for surgery.\n",
      "These include an asymptomatic patient with any of the following: glomerular filtration rate <60 mL/min, bone density T-score <−2.5 at any site and/or previous fractures, age <50, and serum calcium 1.0 ng/dL above the upper limit of normal.3 This patient presented with pain, markedly elevated PTH, and was younger than 50 years old, so it was decided that surgery was the best choice in management.\n",
      "The patient was brought to the operating room and underwent a parathyroidectomy.\n",
      "The surgeon found the parathyroid gland to be firm and densely adherent to the thyroid capsule and overlying strap muscle, making it difficult to dissect.\n",
      "There was no visible invasion into the capsule, surrounding muscle or regional lymph nodes.\n",
      "The resected specimen was noted to be brownish grey in colour with scattered necrotic foci, and irregular texture.\n",
      "On postoperative pathology, the specimen was confirmed positive for parathyroid carcinoma with capsular invasion, focal tumour necrosis, reactive fibrosis and local skeletal muscle invasion (figures 1 and ​2).\n",

      "Immunohistochemical stains showed increased Ki-67 reactivity as well as strong Bcl-1 (cyclin D1) reactivity, which support the diagnosis of parathyroid carcinoma (figure 3).\n",
      "Additionally, P57 staining was negative.\n",
      "Although most reports of parathyroid carcinomas are associated with marked hypercalcaemia, non-functioning cancers in patients tend to behave more aggressively.1 Owing to the severity and uncertainty of the lesion, the patient was followed up postoperatively for repeat imaging to determine if residual tumour remained.\n",
      "Repeat sestamibi and positron emission tomography (PET) scan revealed residual activity along the surgical area so the patient subsequently underwent a second operation for a radical left neck dissection and left hemithyroidectomy.\n",
      "The patient recovered very well postoperatively and it has now been 3 years since the second surgery.\n",
      "The patient continues to do very well and is followed up every 3 months to monitor serum PTH and calcium levels.\n",
      "She no longer reports of neck and shoulder pain.\n",
      "Sometimes the patient's blood tests show marginally elevated PTH levels, however, she remains eucalcaemic and follow-up nuclear scans and PET scans continue to be negative.\n",

      "Echocardiography indicated that he had severe PAH, because his pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP) was 104 mmHg, and his right heart was enlarged (the right ventricle diameter: 57 mm).\n",
      "CTPA showed that he had not only PAH, but also a thrombus in the upper lobe artery of the right lung.\n",
      "However, the region in the lung affected by this PE was considered too small to induce such a severe PAH.\n",
      "In addition, he did not have connective tissue disease, drug use, history of chemotherapy, or HIV test (+), so he was diagnosed as IPAH combined with PE.\n",
      "He was treated with warfarin (2.5 mg per day with a target of the international normalized ratio [INR] between 1.5 and 2.5) and slidenafil targeted PAH therapy (20 mg twice per day).\n",
      "The patient's dyspnea was relieved slightly after the use of these medications for 1 month and the retested PAP by echocardiography was decreased to 72 mmHg, but all the other symptoms and signs failed to further improve after taking these medications for 6 months.\n",
      "In March 2011, he went to the Kyorin University affiliated hospital in Japan for further treatment.\n",
      "Right heart catheterization revealed PAP 72/34/47 mmHg, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) 17/5/10 mmHg, cardiac output 4.3 L/min, cardiac ejection index 2.36 L/min/m2, and pulmonary vascular resistance 7.3 Wood units.\n",
      "He was retested for CTPA that showed that the thrombus in the upper lobe artery of the right lung disappeared.\n",
      "He was still diagnosed as having IPAH, so treated with sildenafil (20 mg 3 times a day) and sorafenib (400 mg once a day) targeted PAH therapy and oral warfarin anticoagulation therapy (2.5–3.75 mg per day, but the daily dose was adjusted by INR that was between 2 and 3).\n",

      "In September 2011, he visited the Shanghai Pulmonary hospital in China because of no relief of dyspnea.\n",
      "Arterial blood gas analysis showed that PaO2 was 63 mmHg with oxygen saturation 93%; lung function test revealed a mild obstructive dysfunction of the pulmonary ventilation (FEV1/FVC 62.06%, FEV1% Prediction 80.9%) and a severe reduction in the diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide (DLCO 42%); 6-minute walk test was 385 m.\n",

      "He was still diagnosed as having IPAH, but he was suspected as actually having PVOD.\n",
      "He was continuously treated with the targeted PAH therapy, and he was asked to continue his anticoagulation treatment, but he stopped warfarin anticoagulation treatment by himself sometime in 2014 (he failed to recall the exact date.) because he felt that it was too cumbersome to frequently test the INR for blood coagulation monitoring.\n",
      "Furthermore, after he discontinued his warfarin therapy, he also failed to monitor D-Dimer to prevent PE recurrence.\n",
      "His dyspnea was relatively stable, but he developed many, but not fatal, episodes of pulmonary edema during the therapy.\n",
      "In January 2015, he was rushed to hospital because his dyspnea was suddenly exacerbated.\n",
      "CTPA showed a thrombus in the right main pulmonary artery (Fig.1C).\n",
      "Rivaroxaban was administered for anticoagulation treatment, but this medication did not relieve his dyspnea, therefore, he was too ill to walk.\n",
      "Instead, he was bound to his wheelchair for half a year.\n",
      "The severe PAH (suspected as PVOD) combined with a life-threatening PE mandates a lung transplantation for his survival.\n",

      "Moreover, VTs with different morphologies and cycle lengths were found during radiofrequency ablation (Figure 4).\n",
      "The substrate voltage mapping revealed that the anterior wall of RVOT was wrapped by circular scar (Figure 5A).\n",
      "Considering the association of VT with scar areas, substrate ablation was chosen for this patient.\n",
      "The residual potentials in the scar areas were searched, and then linear and focal ablations were performed (Figure ​5B).\n",
      "Neither programmed stimulation nor induced stimulation could induce VT after the procedure was completed, indicating the success of operation.\n",

      "A 56-year-old African American man who initially presented with diarrhea, weight loss and painless jaundice, was subsequently found to have adenocarcinoma of the head of pancreas.\n",
      "An initial workup revealed localized cancer with no evidence of distant metastases.\n",
      "He then underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy with complete surgical resection of a 5cm moderately differentiated pancreatic adenocarcinoma.\n",
      "Although our patient underwent complete surgical resection, a pathological examination revealed a neoplastic invasion of the resected adjacent organs, and one out of the seven resected lymph nodes contained cancer (T3N1M0).\n",
      "At that point, the oncology department recommended to proceed with adjuvant chemotherapy with gemcitabine (1000mg/m2 IV on days 1, 8, 15 on a 28-day cycle for six cycles) to try to reduce the likelihood of recurrence.\n",
      "However, after completing two cycles (a total of six doses) of chemotherapy, he presented to the emergency department with worsening exertional dyspnea, three-pillow orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea and fatigue.\n",

      "A chest X-ray showed cardiomegaly with mild to moderate-sized right-sided pleural effusion.\n",
      "It was thought that his presentation was consistent with fluid overload secondary to congestive heart failure (CHF) and he was started on intravenous (IV) furosemide with partial improvement in his symptoms.\n",
      "The next day, a two-dimensional echocardiography (2D Echo) was performed, which showed left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 15 to 20 percent with global hypokinesia along with moderate mitral regurgitation.\n",
      "Given the findings of 2D Echo and the absence of significant risk factors for coronary artery disease (CAD) and ischemic cardiomyopathy (CMP), it was concluded that our patient’s CMP was related to the recent use of gemcitabine.\n",
      "Our patient was then started on carvedilol and an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor in addition to diuretics and he was discharged from the hospital two days later in a euvolemic state.\n",
      "At that point, the cardiology department recommended stopping further chemotherapy with gemcitabine.\n",
      "The oncology department advised further testing to rule out ischemia as a cause of CMP as, in their opinion, chemotherapy with gemcitabine was the only option to reduce the risk of recurrence in this patient.\n",
      "Two weeks later, our patient underwent myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI), which showed a fixed small- to moderate-sized inferior wall defect without any evidence of active ischemia.\n",
      "The ejection fraction (EF) on MPI was calculated to be around 17 to 20 percent with severe global hypokinesia.\n",
      "Our patient was continued on standard heart failure therapy with one more admission to the hospital for CHF exacerbation about two months later.\n",
      "He responded well to IV furosemide and adjustment of heart failure therapy.\n",
      "A 2D Echo was repeated a few months later and it showed improvement in systolic function with an LVEF of 40 percent.\n",
      "Due to his poor functional status and underlying CMP, further gemcitabine chemotherapy was stopped.\n",
      "Later, our patient developed a recurrence of his pancreatic cancer; he refused further chemotherapy and decided to proceed with palliative care.\n",
      "Although the exact etiology of our patient’s dilated cardiomyopathy remains unclear, gemcitabine remains the most likely culprit.\n",
      "The temporal relationship of his symptoms to the initiation of gemcitabine chemotherapy; the lack of risk factors for ischemic CMP and prior history of CAD, finding of global hypokinesia on 2D Echo, absence of ischemia on MPI; and improvement in his systolic function after discontinuation of gemcitabine were all consistent with gemcitabine-induced cardiomyopathy.\n",

      "Following further progression through an experimental angiogenesis inhibitor, she initiated pemetrexed and resumed standard dose erlotinib.\n",
      "After initial response, 11 months later, her disease again progressed.\n",
      "DNA was extracted from biopsy of a progressing lung lesion and examined using established techniques for analysis of EGFR mutations [5].\n",
      "Direct sequencing of exons 18–21 encoding the kinase domain of EGFR revealed the L858R mutation associated with EGFR TKI sensitivity (Fig.1) [2].\n",
      "It also demonstrated the T790M mutation associated with acquired EGFR TKI resistance (Fig.1) [2].\n",
      "She also developed headaches and there was a high clinical suspicion of CNS metastases despite negative imaging (not shown).\n",
      "She refused a lumbar puncture.\n",
      "She initiated empiric temozolomide plus standard dose erlotinib (150 mg daily) for presumed CNS disease, but after one cycle her headaches worsened, and she developed nausea and vomiting concerning for CNS metastases with associated raised intracranial pressure.\n",
      "Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain now demonstrated LM (Fig.2) confirmed by CSF cytology (not shown).\n",
      "By direct sequencing, DNA from CSF cells harbored L858R predicting EGFR TKI sensitivity (Fig.3, left panel) but not the T790M resistance mutation (data not shown).\n",
      "Because the result for T790M was negative in this sample, we performed a more sensitive fluorescence detection PCR-based assay that takes advantage of a PCR restriction fragment length polymorphism generated by the specific missense mutation (Fig.3, right panel, arrow, positive control) [6].\n",
      "That result was also negative, as only the wild type peak was detected (Fig.3, right panel, bottom).\n",
      "Therefore, we hypothesized that the LM remained sensitive to an EGFR TKI if sufficiently high concentrations of drug could be achieved in the CSF.\n",
      "The erlotinib concentration required to inhibit growth of cell lines harboring L858R by 50% (IC50) is 100 nM (nM) [2].\n",
      "Standard dose erlotinib (150 mg daily) achieves 3000 nM in plasma [7], but CSF concentrations of EGFR TKIs are as low as 1% plasma levels below the IC50 [3, 8].\n",
      "Increasing the daily dose of gefitinib to enhance CSF penetration has been an effective strategy [3], but gefitinib is no longer available in the United States following failure in phase III NSCLC trials.\n",
      "An analogous increase of the daily erlotinib dose above 150–200 mg daily induces unacceptable toxicity.\n",
      "However, weekly high-dose erlotinib up to 2000 mg is tolerable [4].\n",
      "Pharmacokinetic analysis of CSF from another patient with NSCLC LM (not shown) treated with 1500 mg erlotinib weekly demonstrated a peak plasma concentration of 11,300 nM with a concurrent CSF concentration of 130 nM.\n",
      "Therefore, such high dose weekly administration of erlotinib achieved a CSF concentration exceeding the IC50.\n",
      "Therefore, to increase CSF penetrance over standard daily erlotinib dosing in this patient, we initiated high-dose weekly erlotinib at 1000 mg then 1200 mg; persistent nausea precluded higher doses.\n",
      "Pharmacokinetic analysis was not undertaken in this patient.\n",
      "After 1 month there was a partial radiographic response of LM on brain MRI (Fig.2b) and after 2 months in the cauda equina (not shown).\n",
      "However, hydrocephalus and persistent symptoms referable to increased intracranial pressure led to a VP shunt and whole-brain radiation therapy, after which she resumed treatment with 1500 mg weekly erlotinib.\n",
      "One month later, progressive intra-thoracic disease led to initiation of cetixumab and erlotinib was continued but changed to low dose (100 mg) daily.\n",
      "She survived 14 months following the diagnosis of CNS disease.\n",

      "The Apgar scores were 4 at 1 min, 7 at 5 min and 9 at 10 min.\n",
      "She was admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit for continuous positive airway pressure ventilation.\n",
      "At a few hours of age, she developed a severe lactic acidosis.\n",
      "The initial lactic acid concentration was 22 mmol/l and subsequently increased to 63 mmol/l (normal range, 0.7–2.1 mmol/l).\n",
      "She was treated with intravenous infusions of sodium bicarbonate and Tris-hydroxymethyl aminomethane (THAM), but it was never possible to correct the metabolic acidosis.\n",
      "She also developed hypoglycaemia within hours of birth that was corrected with an intravenous infusion of 15% glucose (7.8 mg/kg/min).\n",
      "The ammonia concentration was normal.\n",
      "Urine organic acid profile showed massive excretion of lactic acid and increased phenolic acids, especially hydroxyphenyllactate.\n",
      "Plasma amino acids showed raised concentrations of alanine and glutamine (1567 and 1369 μmol/l, respectively), consistent with the lactic acidosis; several other amino acids were also mildly increased.\n",
      "There was gross generalised aminoaciduria.\n",
      "Blood acylcarnitine analysis was normal.\n",
      "Echocardiography showed a structurally normal heart and good ventricular function.\n",
      "Cranial ultrasound showed bilateral intraventricular cysts within the frontal horns and anterior portions of the lateral ventricles.\n",
      "The left-sided cysts were larger, up to 15 mm in diameter, whereas the largest cyst on the right was 8 mm in diameter.\n",
      "The choroid plexuses were hyperechoic and irregular, suggesting previous intraventricular haemorrhage.\n",
      "Abdominal ultrasound showed a distended urinary bladder but was otherwise unremarkable.\n",
      "There was severe coagulopathy with an extended prothrombin time of 47.7 s (normal 12.3–16.6 s), a very low plasma albumin of 7 g/l (normal 35–50 g/l), otherwise normal liver function tests but a raised creatine kinase of 2700 U/l (normal <300 U/l).\n",
      "She was transferred to a tertiary centre because of her worsening metabolic acidosis.\n",
      "She started having seizures at ∼48 h of age.\n",
      "Despite infusions of bicarbonate and THAM, her acidosis continued to worsen.\n",
      "Muscle and skin biopsies were performed and the family agreed to the withdrawal of intensive care treatment.\n",
      "She died aged 55 h.\n",
      "All documented studies were approved and performed under the ethical guidelines issued by each of our Institutions for clinical studies, with written informed consent obtained from the family.\n",

      "A 66-year-old man was admitted into our Hospital in November 2008 with splenomegaly, a high red cell count, and subnormal serum erythropoietin levels.\n",
      "Cytogenetic analysis showed a normal male karyotype.\n",
      "Molecular studies were negative for the BCR-ABL1 rearrangement, but revealed the JAK2V617F mutation with an allele burden of 44.9%.\n",
      "A diagnosis of PV was made on the basis of a morphological bone marrow analysis according to the WHO 2008 criteria.\n",
      "The patient was started on aspirin, hydroxyurea, and phlebotomies, all of which were well tolerated.\n",
      "Six years later, an abdominal ultrasound scan revealed the presence of dense bilateral perinephric infiltration, which was confirmed by a whole-body computed tomography (CT) scan, and a fluotine-18 fluordeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (F-FDG-PET) scan demonstrated increased glucose uptake in the medullary channels of both humeri and femurs.\n",
      "Morphological bone marrow analysis confirmed the previous diagnosis of PV and showed no evident change in the grading of bone marrow fibrosis (MF-0 according to the EUMNET consensus),13 whereas cytogenetic analysis revealed the following complex male karyotype: 47,XY,+9[2/20],47,XY,add(6)(p25),+9[2/20],46,XY[16/20].\n",
      "The histological nature of the perinephric infiltration was identified by means of a CT-guided core biopsy of the lesion.\n",
      "Morphological analysis demonstrated the accumulation of foamy histiocytes that were positive for CD68 and negative for the dendritic cell markers CD1a and S100, surrounded by fibrosis and a scanty lympho-monocytic infiltrate (Figure ​(Figure1).1).\n",
      "The detection of the BRAFV600E mutation led to a diagnosis of ECD.\n",
      "Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed pseudo-tumoral infiltration of the atrioventricular wall,14 and a bone scan showed symmetrically irregular radiotracer uptake in the long bones of the limbs consistent with ECD (Figure ​(Figure22)2; the findings of cerebral and pulmonary imaging were negative.\n",
      "In accordance with the most recent guidelines for the treatment of ECD,1 the patient started therapy with pegylated interferon (IFN)-alpha and, after 3 months of treatment, a new abdominal ultrasound scan revealed the complete resolution of the dense bilateral perinephric infiltration, and the normalization of the blood cell counts was achieved.\n",
